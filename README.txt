I included all of the colors in my color pallete (in h1, h2, ul, h2 background, and in p)

I tried 5 html tags - img, table, link, audio, small

I couldn't get img or audio to work... I uploaded them to assets and I tried to 
include them in the server code to send the files, but I couldn't get them to work 
in glitch despite trying different file types

I have 5 CSS tags - background, text-align, border style, border, and font weight
