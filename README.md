Achievements

*Technical*
1. CSS styling. In this assignment I used 6 style rules, mostly to use coloring palette and creating borders for table. I also used some styling for my js animation in the bottom of the website
2. I have Futuristic Typing text JavaScript animation with funny text (Hope you will enjoy it). I created new JS file and connected it to html by <script> tag.
3. I used 2 <a> tags to show some information about my country and also to show link to my latest project. I used 'i' tag to show that I'm really passionate about boxing, and 'b' tag showing that video games plays a big role in my life. I also used table to show CS courses that I took before.
