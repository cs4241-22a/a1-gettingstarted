This project shows my getting started project. This is an introduction to HTML and CSS for me, and I used it to show some introductory information about me.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: I used 11 different styling rules in my CSS file. 
    - "*": sets up the base of the page
    - "container": provides color to the page
    - "leftheader": styles the "hello!"
    - "rightheader": styles the right header
    - "underline1": styles the first line in the rainbow underline
    - "underline2": styles the second line in the rainbow underline
    - "underline3": styles the third line in the rainbow underline
    - "underline4": styles the fourth line in the rainbow underline
    - "aboutme": styles the section about my interests
    - "cscourses": styles the section about some courses I have taken
    - "technology": styles the section about technologies and my experience with them
    
- **Added an animation with CSS**: I added a rotation of colors for the "Hello!" header I have on my page. I completed this using CSS and HTML. This was difficult because I had to figure out the "from" statements with the percentages and also how to implement how long it would run and make it run infinite.
- **Experimented with other tags**: I used a lot of the "<div>" tag


### Design Achievements

- **Used the Alice and Sacramento Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used the Sacramento font for the "Hello!" and the Alice font for everything else.
- **Used a color palette**: I decided on a triad color scheme and used the following hex codes throughout: #DEB8D4, #EBDD96, #EB7FD0, #67EBE9, #4D9E9D
