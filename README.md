- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**:

  I added a simple console animation based on tutorials on the Internet.
 
  It will loop through the three options **'Hello World!', 'CS4241', 'SIZHE LI =V='**

- **Experiment with other HTML tags**:

  1.Used **div** to create the object for JavaScript animations.
  
  2.Used **a** to add a link to https://www.wpi.edu/
  
  3.Used **img** to add a picture into **a** . Once user click the image of wpi, it will navigate the user to https://www.wpi.edu/
 
  4.Used **footer** to print the name and year at the bottom of web page
  
  5.Used **audio** to embed the audio into  HTML document. Users can start playback, adjust volume and playback speed independently.
