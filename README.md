This project shows a basic understanding of the basics of javascript and 
introduces myselfand my computer science background a little bit.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Changed background color; changed all text colors;
  gave left margins to h2, li, and p; made h1 bold; made h1 center-aligned. This
  was not particularly difficult because some of this was demoed in class, and the
  rest could be done in a very similar fashion.
- **Added HTML Tags**: Linked to ChaosSearch website; added a footer ('this page
  brought to you by me'); made the footer small text; emphasized (italicized) 'WPI
  Class of 2023'; put image of me and my late alpaca into the website. Most of
  these were particularly challenging because I used a library to look at HTML tags
  and understand how they were used. The alpaca image was challenging at first, but
  once I got it loaded onto the website and used the correct link, I got it to work.

### Design Achievements

- **Used a Color Palette from Adobe**: included all 5 colors as h1, h2, li, p,
  and the background. I found it difficult to make a set of colors appealing in the
  webpage, and in the future would hope to add larger blocks of color to make the
  page look better.
- **Used the Sofia Font from Google Fonts**: used Sofia as the h1 font. This was not
  working for a while, but once I realized that I had to "import" the font, it then 
  worked like a charm.
