This project shows introductory uses of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to display information about myself, including a short background and some of the classes I have taken at WPI.  The project is displayed on a web server using Glitch and can be found at the link above.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
    - body: changed the background color
    - h1 and h2: changed the font to Verdana
    - h2: underlined heading and colored it with #99DAE8
    - ul li: changed the bullet points to be spades
    - added a rectangle at the top of the screen highlighting the title of the page
- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: I used a JavaScript function to declare an array of four colors and every second, change the color of the rectangle at the top of the screen. This creates and animation where the colors flash on the screen repeatedly.
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**:
    - <link> used to link a Google font and an external CSS style sheet
    - <script> used to add a JavaScript function
    - <div> used to create a rectangle and used in the JavaScript function to grab the element and change it's color
    -<b> used to bold the text "class of 2023"
    -<u> used to underline the text "Working Experience"

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Create a color palette using color.adobe.com**: I created a color palette and used these colors for the background of the webpage, the bullet points, and to change the color of the rectangle at the top. The colors are a blend between blue and green with a screenshot of the color wheel and hex numbers being included in the repository under the file name "palette.png"
