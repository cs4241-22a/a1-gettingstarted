This project shows a small self-introduction including my previous work and course work experience. 

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: The Mukta font was defined for the whole page using the \* selector. The body selector changes the font and background colors to match my chosen color palette and define the page's padding. The img selector restricts the image size and adds a colored border matching the palette. The th selector change the text alignment to the left-hand side and eliminates the default bold weight. The named col and row divs are styled to make the presented info more compact, and restrict the max-width on wider screens. There selectors for none, some, and alot divs which have widths corresponding to the experience level. The colors also are part of the chosen palette.
- **Used additional HTML tags**: I used an img tag to include a profile picture of myself and an a tag for my github page. I used a table tag (including tbody,td,th) to display my programming experience. I also added div tags used to control the layout of the page, specified in the style.css file.

### Design Achievements

- **Used a color palette**: I created a color palette using color.adobe.com and used it for background, text, and accent colors. The palette can be seen in colorpalette.png or as used in the style.css file.
- **Used the Mukta Font from Google Fonts**: I used the Mukta font for all text on my site.
