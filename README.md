Assignment details
---
To satisfy the basic requirements for this project, I made sure git and gitBash were up-to-date on my current PC, forked this repo from cs4241-22a/a1-gettingstarted, and then used the terminal on my computer to get a local copy that I could repeatedly pull from to check my progress. I included the required information relating to my course experience and work experience, as well as a few basic facts about myself. 

I then spent time experimenting with the technical and design achievements, and chose to focus on using google fonts, the adobe color palette, and various CSS style rules to create a visually appealing website. I drew from previous courses' javascript/html experience as well as the web articles listed at the bottom of this readMe. 

One challenge I faced was my attempt to include music that autoplays when you open my website- this feature is blocked by google chrome likely to prevent advertisements from autoplaying. After realizing this would not be possible I decided to include the controls to start and stop the smooth jazz I wanted to include,
Herb Ellis & Remo Palmier - A1 Windflower (1978), and styled the audio controls using my color palette.
