This project shows a webpage using HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript to present information about Ryan Luu, a Computer Science major of the Class of 2023 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
I was able to design a introductory page with a working clock. I always like to know what time it is, so adding the time when you click a button was something I thought of.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors...
  - The tag h1: Used the color, background, border, font sizing and font-family (with font from Google Fonts e.g. Silkscreen).
  - The tag h2: Used the color and font-family (with font from Google Fonts e.g. Silkscreen)
  - The tag div: Used the class tag to specify certain objects that required their only CSS styles.
  - The tag img: Resized the photo using margins, border and sizing options and positional floats.
  - The tag p: Transforming normal text to italicized and bigger sizing.
  - The tag li: Edited bullets from circles to fit the style of the main Head
  - The tag body: Gave background color to the entire page.
  - The tag table, th, and td: Tables were given borders and background colors. The table also shows my information regarding my
    CS experience at WPI.
  - The tag footer: Added signature copyright.
- **Links and Assets Used**:
  - Images that were used included photos resourced from myself.
  - Fonts were uploaded from Google Fonts as assets and then applied through the URL that was hosted by Glitch.

### Design Achievements

- **Used the Silkscreen Font from Google Fonts**: I used Silkscreen as the font for the primary header text in my site and Serif
  being the font for my primary text.
- **The color palette that I selected came from Adobe Color Palette**: It will be attached as a file to my repo.
