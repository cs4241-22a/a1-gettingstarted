This project shows information about me, Jordan Wecler!

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1, h2, div, body, and img selectors. I gave both headers a font style and color, as well as all other text in the body. To keep all text boxes together I put them in two different divs, which were styled with a border and background of the same color. I gave the entire body text a font type and weight, as well as a background color and margin.
- **Used other HTML tags**: Used the link tag for importing a new font and for inserting an image into the body (https://www.wpi.edu/sites/default/files/2016/07/22/about-wpi-hero-1400x650.jpg).

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Archivo Black and Catamaran fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Archivo Black as the header font for my site, and Catamaran as the body font.
- **Used Adobe Color to create a full color pallete**: I used a complementary color pallete style of five colors and implemented each color into my site in different parts, like font and background color.
