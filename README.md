This project shows some personal information about myself including some of the classes I have taken. There is basic use of HTML and CSS within the project along with
extra features to do with the CSS and Google Fonts.

## Technical Achievements
I added a few different CSS features to the body, p, h1, h2, and li. The features I used are below in a list:
- Background image (background-image and background-color) and color to have an overarching background for the website
- Set the font colors to Blue (color: blue) to make it easier to read
- Added single and double borders to the text sections (border)
- Set the position to relative so that I could move the different bodies of text around (position, top, left)

I also used a background image that left different portions of the screen availible for text. This was so that I could become more familiar with the use of top and left by finding out the best positions.

### Design Achievements
I also used Google Fonts to use the font Aboreto Regular. I'm not sure why but only some characters worked with this font. I followed instructions from the following website to do this: https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/how-to-add-custom-fonts-to-any-website
