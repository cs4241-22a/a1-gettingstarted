This project acts as a brush up on HTML, CSS and Git, as well as figuring out Glitch

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1, h2, p, ul, body, table, th and td. Mostly changed text color, but also the background color for h1 and body, and added a border to h2 and the table
- **Experimented with other HTML tags** formatted my course list as a table

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Happy Monkey Font from Google Fonts**: I used Happy Monkey as the font for the first header in my site.
- **Created a color palette using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com)** which is the blues of the site, but not the peach color on the table headers. The palette is colorGrid.png, because the colors I picked overlap on the wheel so the grid with the hex codes seemed a bit more useful.
