## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body and h1 selectors. ID'd the 3 different p selectors so I was able to add rules for each selector separately. Changes include the background color, font style and size, and text alignment on the page.
- **HTML Tags**: Used multiple "br" tags to format my paragraphs. Used the "a" tag to add a hyper link. Used the "b" tag to bold the top of two of my paragraphs.

## Design Achievements

- **Used the Oxygen Font from Google Fonts**: I used Oxygen as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used a color pallete from color.adobe.com**: I used a color pallete I created in my website. All 5 colors in the pallete as used,
  and there is a screenshot of the color wheel for the pallete in my repo.
