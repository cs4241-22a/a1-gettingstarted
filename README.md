## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added a border to the image, as well as a border radius in order to round it. Added a drop shadow and border radius to the boxes displaying previous courses and experience. I centered everything in their respective container and I removed the list styling from the list items in the boxes.
- **Animation**: Added simple "animation" that changes between the cs course names and numbers
- **HTML Tags**: I used an <img> tag at the top of the page

### Design Achievements
