## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added margin/padding rules to many HTML elements; set the background-color, font family, font weight and border styles of various elements using class and element selectors.
- **Added a JS animation**: Made the horizontal rule under the title change between two different colors from the site's palette.
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: Used the anchor tag to link to an external site, the img tag to add an image of my face, the hr tag to create a horizontal rule, and the div tag to create page divisions that could hold block-level elements inside of themselves (unlike the paragraph element)

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the title and subtitle; I promise I didn't see this example first lol
- **Created and used a color palette**: I used coolors.co to create and use a color palette for the site.
