## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the different font colors, the background color, the font sizes, font colors, scroll bar, p color, li color, and overflow to define when the custom scrollbar should show up.
- **Added JavaScript animation**: Used JavaScript to trigger a "winking" animation every 5 seconds.
- **Experimented with HTML tags**: Split the page into two columns with the main and aside tags, added a logo with an img tag, and styled the experience section with a monospaced font through code, and italized the "Hi!" in my header with em, and broke up the h2 text with span.

### Design Achievements

- **Created a Color Palette**: Three of the colors from the palette to style the h1, h2, and .grad class of text, and the other 2 colors to style the image I created for the logo. I styled the background with and offwhite color and the p text inspired by the  by the generated color palette.
- **Used the Roboto Font and Abril Fatface Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto for the font of the paragraphs and Abril Fatface for all header text.
