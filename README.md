This project shows my basic information in WPI. It really looks like an old WPI webpage which is what I was looking for.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added background colour and text colour. Added margin to body.
- **other tags**: Added an image of WPI quad. Used `div` `link` `img` `a`
- **Added Javascript animation**
### Design Achievements
- **Used Adobe to created a colour set**
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used IBM Plex Mono as the font for the list item text in my site.
