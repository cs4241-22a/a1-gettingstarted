This project shows a web page about me. It introduces me, my major and my hobbies. It also shows previous CS courses I have taken, working experience and my technical experience.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, body, h1, h2, table, th and td. (background color, color, padding, border, border spacing)
- **Experiment with other HTML links**: I created a table using the td and th tags for the labels and the information. I also design the table in the CSS file by giving the table a border and putting color to all of it.

### Design Achievements

- **Create a color palette using adobe**: I created this color palette using adobe. My favorite color is blue so I kind of wanted this website to represent me more by having differeent shades of blue.
