!!!!!!!!!! EPILEPSY WARNING!!!!!!!!!!

For this assignment, I wrote information about myself to share with the professor.

For my achievements, I made my website bounce up and down and left and right before eventually deciding to leave.  The colors of the text and background also bounce around in similar fashion.
