This project shows an intro to web design, including HTML tags, CSS customization, and JavaScript animations. I tried to utilize as many elements as I could to become familiar with them, especially those I havent worked with before. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Experimented With HTML Tags**: Utilized underlines, headings, paragraphs, breaks, labels/dropdowns, images, buttons and tables. I picked these to try new tags, and practice tags that require mutltiple elements (i.e. table). 
- **Styled Page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, headings 1-3, paragraph, buttons, images, labels, and selection./
  - H1 was the main header at the top with my name
  - H2 was the header for Experience
  - H3 was the header for the table about tables.
- **Added a Simple JavaScript Animation**: Used JavaScript to create a moving box located at the bottom of the page. Animation is triggered by a button. This uses a setInterval() to update the animation and move the block.


### Design Achievements
- **Used the Raleway Font from Google Fonts**: I used Raleway as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used a color palette**: Used a four tone palette from adobe.\
#1F2529 - Primary\
#F74422 - Secondary\
#A4C4D9 - Lighter Blue\
#29384C - Darker Blue\
