This project shows my personal page that I made for the assignment 1. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added style rules for the body, p, h1, h2, table and links.And used properties such as background-color, margins, padding, border, text-align, color of the text, font-style, etc.

- **JavaScript animation**: I tried a couple things but as I have never worked with Javascript so I kept failing but I still included some of the code but commented it out in the animation.js file. I'll work it again.

- **HTML tags**: I experimented with multiple HTML tags such as Images (WPI on top of the page), table(for the experience), lists(for the CS classes), divisions (for every different section), links (to my github and linkedIn at the bottom of the page)

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Michroma Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the Heading in my site. 

- **Used the Color Wheel from Adobe**: I have used all the colors suggested in different parts of the site. I used the #D6CA9F as the background color of the page, #F5413D for the Heading background, #1B213D for just the paragraph text and #CC4567 for the h2 and unvisited links and #23EB52 for visited links at the bottom of the page.
