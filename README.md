## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for body, h2, img, hr, li, selectors.
body's background color + font is changed, also added fade in animation on load. Also added max-width and margins for center alignment.
h2 has custom color, font side and text decoration (underline).
img has set height, margins and a left float, also a background color for behind the transparent image.
hr has custom margin and thicker outline. 
li has custom bullet points.
- **Added class selectors**: Added classes + styles for header, container-box, and icon. Also added ids + styles for box-1, box-2.
.container-box has custom borders to mimic Windows 95 windows, margin for spacing between boxes, + background color.
.header has custom width + height, background color, font weight and padding.
.icon has the same borders as .container-box, plus a set width + height, margins, and vertical + horizontal align to center the x. Vertical align was achieved using a line-height equal to the height of the div.
box-1 and box-2 have padding, plus box-1 has a set height.
- **Fade in animation**: Added a custom fadeIn animation that runs when the page is loaded, with the @keyframes annotation to set the opacity at the beginning and end of the animation.
