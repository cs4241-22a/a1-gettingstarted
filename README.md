This project shows the following achievements:

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for body, h1, h2, p, li, summary, table, th, td, and img. An example of how these rules apply is change color of the text,
background color, margins, padding, width, height, and borders. I tried to experiment with a bunch of things, since I didn't use html or css for a long time. The table
also has a hovering feature, so the cells change color if the mouse points at them.
- **Added JavaScript animation**: I flip through 3 pusheen images for the icon.
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: I used other tags such as table, th, td, tr, details, summary, a, img, div. For images I used the following links:
