This project shows my ability to make a semi-decent webpage and run it on a server.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
  1. Added borders to the table cells, and border collapse to the table so it would have one border
  2. Set the cell widths to 25% so they were all evenly spaced
  3. Set the text color in columns 2 and 3 of the table to green and red, respectively. Also made them bold for readability
  4. Styled the footer to sit centered at the bottom of the page
- **Styled page with tags**:
  1. Added link to a css page
  2. Added a table for the experience labeling
  3. Added a footer to place text at the bottom of the page
## Design Achievements
- **Used a split complementary color scheme from Adobe**
- **Used the Bricolage Grotesque font family from Google**
