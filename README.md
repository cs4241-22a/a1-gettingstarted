This project gives a self-introduction along with courses I've taken and my experience as a programmer in both technical and work aspects.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added color rules for the h1, h2, p, li, and table selectors. I also added 5 distinct rules for the h1 selector, among those being color, font, font size, border, and a bottom margin.

- **JavaScript Animation**: I added a simple animation that uses the setInterval() function to alternate the color of a sentence on my site between purple and blue.

- **HTML Tags**: I experimented with 5 different HTML tags. I added a clickable link using the 'a' tag, added a table with the 'table' tag (also used 'tr', 'th', and 'td' tags to fill my technical experience information into the table), used the 'img' tag to add an image (WPI logo), used the 'iframe' tag to embed a video from YouTube, and the 'button' tag to create a button on my site.

### Design Achievements
- **Color Palette**: I created a color palette with Adobe Color and utilized each of the five colors throughout my site. One color was used for h1 headers, one for h2 headers, one for p text, one for list (li) elements, and one for the border color on the table I created.

- **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat as the font for the h1 header on my site.
