This project tells the reader a little bit about myself, with some included styling, images, and links.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: The following rules were added:
1. The body selector received a background color.
2. The h1 selector received a font, centering margin, color, sizing, and border.
3. The h2, h3, and p selectors received a font, size, and weight.
4. The h2, h3, and p selectors were given separate colors.
5. The ol and ul selectors received a color, font, border, font size, and width.

- **Extra HTML Tags**: The following tags were added:
1. The "a" tag was used for hyperlinks to other websites and images.
2. The "ol" tag was used for an ordered (numbered) list.
3. The "ul" tag was used for an unordered (bullets) list.
4. The "li" tag was used for elements in each of these lists.
5. the "link" tag was used to link a stylesheet.


### Design Achievements

the site using the palette, and a screenshot of the palette used was included in the repo.
