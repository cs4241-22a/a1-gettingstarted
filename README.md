## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, li, and img selectors. The font family for the entire stylesheet was set to the Google Font PT Sans Narrow. The body has a change in background-color. h1, h2, p, and li have changes in font colors. img has a border added, a width of 400 px set, a max-width of 50%, and a height that is automatically set.
- **Added a simple Javascript animation to the page**: The Javascript provided within index.html moves the position of the dog image over to the right. It is called by the user pressing on the button labeled "Click Here!".
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: Added tags including <a>, <button>, and <img>. <a> was used as a link for the text "Worcester Polytechnic Institute", <button> was used to begin the Javascript animation of the dog, and <img> was used to display an image of the Guide Dog described.
