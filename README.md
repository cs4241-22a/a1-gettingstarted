## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for li, h2, h3, and p to adjust the font color based on the Adobe color pallete I created (attached in repo). Added rule to ul with the class "list" to adjust the line spacing to match the spacing of the checkboxes. Added rules to the inputs with checkboxes to adjust the color of them to complement the color pallete used. Added rules to the body to change the background color and font of all the text. Added rule to h1 to change the size and color of the text.
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: Used input tag to add checkboxes with text.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette using Adobe**: A screenshot of the color pallete is provided in the repo.
- **Used the Oswald Font from Google Fonts**: I used Oswald as the font as the primary font in my site.
