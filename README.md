used font-size to change the font's size, color to change the text's color, background-color to change the 
background's color, text-decoration to underline text, and font-weight to bold text
- **#2 Added JavaScript Animation**: For my animation, I am switching the text "Information about Mason Powell" to be
three different colors

- to put a link to my GitHub, and hr to make horizontal lines
