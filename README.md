## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
    - For the body I added a dark background color to make the fonts on top pop, and I also centered it.
    - For heading 1, I aligned the text in the center, gave it a cute font, set the font color to be lighter than the background, and gave the entire text its own background to make it stand out even more.
    - For heading 2, I did everything I did for heading 1 minus a background color. 
    - For the paragraphs, I aligned the text in the center, gave it a different font than the headings so it would look different, and made it a lighter color than the headers.
    - For the table, th, td, I gave it a border to make it look more organized and changed the font and color to match the paragraphs (p). I also edited the tr to change the color of the boxes in the table when someone hovers over it.
    - For the unordered list (ul + li), I gave it the same color and font as the p and table text. I also center aligned it and make it so the bullet points are next to the list items.

    - I added hyperlinks in my table that lead to the webpage describing the corresponding CS class and I used a table to outline my CS classes.


### Design Achievements
- **Used Google Fonts**: I used two fonts from Google Fonts. One was Fredoka One which I used for my headers, and the other was Varela Round which I used for the other texts. 

- **Used color palette from color.adobe.com**: I used a color palette to inspire the color scheme behind my website. I did edit the colors once they were on my site to look better.
