## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, h1, h2, body, table, and ul selectors. Unique rules include padding-left, font, color, background-image, text-shadow, etc. It was challenging to make each text readable given the background image.
- **Experimented with other tags**: Added Table and Marquee tags. 

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette**: The screenshot is named ColorPalette.jpg. The first color is used in sub headers, the second in main headers and small text, the third in the text shadow of the headers (h1, h2), 
				the fourth in the borders of the table and the background of the marquee, and the fifth in the background color for the headers. It was challenging to make the text stand out from the background and to clearly mark each section.
- **Used the Sofia Font from Google Fonts**: I used Sofia as the font for the main h1 title header.
