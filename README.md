## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors
- **Included href to link to other sites**: I used 'a' tags to link to other sites including my website and WPI. Not too difficult...shown in class
- **Used an ordered list tag**: I used an ordered list to list my previous classes. Using an ordered list wasn't too difficult, but figuring out how to make it drop down was.
- **Used a details tag**: I used the 'details' tag to create a dropdown menu for my ordered list
- **Used a hidden tag**: I used a hidden tag to make a paragraph not visible on the site. Not too difficult, just added 'hidden' to 'p' tag
- **Used a class selector**: I added a class to a 'p' tag so I could just select that paragraph. It was difficult to figure out how to select it in CSS.
- **Created a footer**: I created a footer for the page including copywright symbol. The difficult part was centering it and finding the copywright symbol
- **Added in a checkbox**: I created a checkbox to ask for input if they had taken the same classes as me.

### CSS Styles
- **Centered footer**: Difficult to figure out how to select the class
- **Changed ordered list color**: Needed to change ul to ol
- **Changed paragraph font to be Google font**: Needed to find a font and figure out how to import it into the site
- **Changed colors of header 1**: Just needed to find two colors that worked well so that text could be seen well
- **Removed underline from links in 'a' tag**: Difficult to figure out what method removed underlining
- **Changed font size of dropdown menu**: Not too difficult, just needed to select 'details' tag
- **Bolded the intro**: Challenging to figure out how to select the class, had to guess and check a couple times

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Anek Telugu Font from Google Fonts**: I used Anek Telugu as the font for the primary copy text in my site. 
-**Created color palette**: I created a color palette using color.adobe.com and used all the colors in my webpage.
