## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1, h2, and main selectors, as well as the custom bgimg, bgcont, and bgtext selectors. Main was given a colored background and a border, and a filter that blurs any background elements. h1 and h2 were given a separate background color, text decorations, and a drop shadow. h1 also has a custom margin. bgimg, bgcont, and bgtext are given absolute positions, with each type having a different role on the page to position the background image and animated text. bgtext in particular rotates the contained text 90 degrees.
 - **Simple JavaScript animation**: The rotated background text scrolls upwards over time.
 - **Additional HTML tags**: In addition to the standard tags, I also used a <a> link tag (which links to my GitHub account). I used <ul> and <li> tags for the lists of my previous CS classes and experience levels. <form>, <label>, and <input> tags were used for the guestbook form at the bottom of the page. <img> was used to display the WPI logo in the background.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a custom palette from Adobe Color**: I used a green and purple compound color palette in my site. The backgrounds are green, and the text and details are purple.
- **Used the Gantari Font from Google Fonts**: I used Gantari as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
