This project is an exercise in creating a website using the fundamentals of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.JS, and Markdown.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added style rules for the body, h1, li, div, and q selectors to make each aspect of my page unique. I also created a class for the contents inside the dotted box at the top of my page called PerInfo, and added css style rules.
- **Added Javascript animation**: I added a button that when pressed calls a function inside script.js that spins my profile picture.
- **Experimented with HTML tags**: I used the div tag to section off part of my page to use specific style rules on it. I used the img tag to add a profile image to the top of the page. I used the button tag to add buttons that affect the page in various ways using functions from my script.js file. One button spins my profile image and another button cycles through colors for the body text. I used the q tag inside of a p tag to add a short quotation to the bottom of my page. I used the iframe tag to embed a youtube video in the bottom of the page. I used the input tag to make a color picker that allows the user to change the color of the body text at will, and the label tag to provide a label for that input. I used the script tag to be able to use the functions in my script.js file in my html code.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color pallete**: I created a color palette on [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com) to make a fixed gradient background for my page. Here is my palette:<br/>![Theo's color palette](https://github.com/tjcoppola234/a1-gettingstarted/blob/main/Color_Pallete.jpg?raw=true)
- **Used a google font**: I used the Roboto Mono font family for the majority of the text on my page. The script link is included at the top of the html code.
