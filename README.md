HOW I DID IT!

August 24, 2023

Started with the index.html and put info on myself. I then went on to create color palettes, ending with me choosing the "Hylian Palette" (just some colors from the Hylian Shield and a shade of green) and applying it to the page. I then did research on how to actually use fonts in CSS, then found the "Press Start 2P" font on Google and applied it to all text in the HTML.
