## About this project

This project is a basic webpage that was created using pure HTML, CSS, and JS. There are two pages that can be navigated to and from, which are the **home** page and the **experiences** page. The user will start on the **home** page and will have the option to navigate to the **experiences** page through a hyperlink at the end of the page. Each page shares a common CSS file which is titled _main.css_. In this file, there are many styling rules that constrain each page to a common look. Additionally, there is another CSS file titled _progress.css_ that houses the styling rules for the progress bars on the **experience** page. Each CSS file makes use of the _flexbox_ workflow and has a media query that changes the direction depending on the size of the window.

## Technical Achievements

#### Style with CSS

As stated in the about section, each page utilized many CSS styling rules to change its overall look. Rules were added for **h1**, **table**, **body**, and **a**; there was also a CSS reset that was added that utilized the star selector. In addition to the many rules that were added, there were also _classes_ and _ids_ created for the page layout. An example of a class that was used was the **.container** selector that managed the pages flex properties. An example of an id that was created was the **#site-header** that centered the panda logo and gave it height.

#### Experiment with other HTML tags

Many other HTML tags were used for the organization of the markup as well as the functionality. Some tags that were used are: **header**, **table**, **td**, **main**, **br**, **footer**, **img**, and **a**. Tags such as **header** were used for the panda logo at the top of the page. I chose to use this instead of a **div** as this helps categorize the markup better. **Table **and **td** were used to easily center some text on the screen instead of creating a new **div** with different flex properties. The **main** tag was used for organization as well as applying one of our classes for styling. The **br** tag was used for its purpose and the **img** tag was used for the panda icon in the header. The **a** tag was used for page navigation, such as going to the **home** page from the **experience** page. A **footer** was used to make a disclaimer at the bottom of _experience.html_.

#### JS Animation

This isn’t a “JS animation” but if you hold down the panda logo while on the **home** page, it will start violently shaking. Just something fun to look at.

## Design Achievements

#### Google Font Implementation

I used Roboto at the 100 font weight for my primary font. The import code can be seen at the top of _main.css_.

#### Use a Color Palette

I used **Lyft’s ColorBox** to generate a color palette for my page (approved on Discord). This color palette can be seen below and is specifically utilized in _experience.html_. Because the theme of my page is black and white, it was difficult to find a good place to use it. I eventually decided to use the colors on my skill graph on this page and it gives it a nice look.
