## Technical Achievements
- **Add a simple JavaScript Animation**: I animated a sliding wavey text displaying "nice to meet you" at the top of the page. Hover over "hi, i'm neha" to get animated, popping images/font change. The button displaying my link to linkedIn also has a hover animation.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1 (bold header greeter w/ custom font), h2 (bold sub-headers w/ custom font), p (paragraph text w/ custom font), li(list w/ custom font), link labels (links w/ custom font and hover highlights), a, svg waves, buttons.
- **Experiment with HTML tags**: Images tag to display images when hovering over "hi, i'm neha", Link tag to link company websites when clicking on "WPI IDeaS Studio" and "Oracle", List tag to list experiences and courses, Script tag to write basic functions for animations, SVG tag to create curving text animation, Animate tag to animate curving text, TextPath tag to warp text around curve. Button to link LinkedIn.
### Design Achievements
- **Used the fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat, Play and Playfair Italic as the primary fonts for my website.
- **Adobe Color Theme**: I created color swatches and used them in my website. #FFFFFF is the background color. #000000 is the text color. #DAD0FF is the highlight color when hovering over "WPI IDeaS Studio". #A4EBE5 is the highlight color when hovering over "Oracle". #FFB19C is the drop shadow color for the button.
