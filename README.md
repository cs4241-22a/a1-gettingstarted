This project shows that I can make a website on glitch and also use CSS and JavaScript.
I had the same issue we had in class, so the version on glitch is different than the version in the repo. There is a comment in index.html explaining more.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Changed background color, p color, p highlight color, th hover color, body hover color, body text, and some other things.
- **Added a JavaScript animation**: I added an animation that makes the image rotate
- **Used different HTML tags**: Used a, img, table, td, th, br, and hr.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette from Adobe**: I used the color palette shown in colorwheel.png.
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
