This project shows a basic webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Technical Achievements
- **Incorporated tables**: Used the HTML element table (and row elements th and td) to format the language and class information.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the table, th, and td selectors. This formats the table to have a border, and formats table entries to be centered. 
- **Used custom CSS style classes**: Created custom classes for coloring background colors green, yellow, and red, and used them with the class attribute to style specific elements.
- **Created animated rainbow text**: Included a script which identifies the element with id rainbow and updates its color such that it appears to cycle through all of the colors in the rainbow.

### Design Achievements
- **Color coded levels of experience**: Colored the background of the cells in the language table based on the level of experience for that row: green for a lot of experience, yellow for some experience, and red for no experience.
- **Used the Montserrat font from Google Fonts**: Used the link element to fetch Montserrat from Google Fonts, and applied this font to the entire body.
