This project shows my ablity to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a resume-like website showcasing information about me including my name, class year, major, computer science course work, experience with web-based technology, and other things. I tried to add CSS features to make the site more reactive

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for img (height, position, border-style, border-width, border-color), h1 (width, font-size, color), div (display, align items), video (width, positon, border-style, border-width, border-color), p (font-size), h2 (color), h3 (color) table (border, font size) and others
- **Simple JavaScript animation**: On the top of the page, a square bounces between the left and right size, changing color when it changes direction.
- **HTML Tags**: Some of the extra tags I use are \<img\>, \<video\>, \<table\>, \<div\>, and \<i\>.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Graduate Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Implented a color palette**: See colorwheel.png
