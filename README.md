## technical achievements
- **styled page with CSS**: added rules for background-color, font-family, font-size, font-style, color, border, text-shadow, animation-name, animation-duration, animation-iteration-count. i also created a simple animation but it's using CSS not JS for it so i'm not sure if that counts as an additional technical achievement or if it's part of this one. who knows.

### design achievements
- **used the Vast Shadow font from google fonts**: i used Vast Shadow as the font for all text in my site
- **created a color palette using color.adobe.com**: the 5 colors are shown in the screenshot attached to the repo and all of them are used in my site
