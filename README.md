This project shows information about my education, including my class year, majors, and completed courses, as well as my level of experience with different technologies and my work experiences.

### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added rules for the h2, img, th, td, ul, and a selectors. For the h2 header, I added a text-decoration of underline and styled this underline to be a different color from the text color. I also made the underline thicker. For the image, I made the max-width 25%. For the table, I styled the table headers to have a different background color from the table data. I also centered the text and added padding to the table. For the list, I changed the list-style-type to an open circle. Lastly, I changed the color of the link and removed the underline. The underline only appears on hover now.
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**: I used the setInterval() function to select the span element from the page and alternate the text color between two colors.
- **Added other HTML tags**: I used the link tag to link to the WPI CS Department webpage, the image tag to insert the WPI logo, and the table tag to display information about my experience with different technologies. Nested within the table tag, I used tr to create the table rows, th to create table headers, and td to add table data. I also used the span tag so that I could style my name differently from the rest of the h1 header.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette using color.adobe.com**: I used all of the colors from the color palette in the palette.png file in my webpage. I used one color for the text, one for underlines, one for table headers, one for table data, and one for the link.
- **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat as the text font in my webpage.
