              Hello! My name is Qui Nguyen (<i>kwee win / gwee ng-wen</i>) and I
              am from the class of 2024. I am currently pursuing a BS in
              Computer Science and am in the process to change that to include
              an MS. Because it is my third year at WPI, I have taken many other
              CS-based courses before. These courses are listed below.

              At WPI, I am a part of ITS, SASE, VSA, WooJa, and UPE. This
              upcoming B-term, I will be completing my MQP with the WooSox to
              implement Standard Cognition into their ballpark.

              My work experience consist of mostly working for startup companies
              or my CS3733 Software Engineering course. One of the companies,
              <i>Achilles Travel Health</i>, is located in Silicon Valley and is
              developing a health application for public use. I primarily used
              JavaScript in the form of React Native and Firebase for my
              BaaS.For tool experience, you can find those
