      I am an RBE/CS double and a senior trying to break the record for speedrunning a CS degree.
      <br> I took Dr. Racket & object oriented at the start of freshman year, then every RBE class, and
      <br> then decided to double major and took discrete math, algos, computer graphics, and computer
      <br> ethics.

      I once did a research project on laserbees in high school.  It was the only reason I got in to this school.
