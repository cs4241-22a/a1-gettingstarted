    <p>
      I am a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute expecting to graduate in May of 2023. I am originally from Long Island, New York,
      but I am hoping to stay in the greater Boston area after finishing school.
      I am double majoring in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology as well as Computer Science!
      In addition to my studies, I love to remain highly involved in my community at WPI. I have been a member of Alden Voices Choir and Technichords Acapella since 2019,
      and I currently act as Business Manager for the Technichords. I'm also a sister of Alpha Xi Delta, a member of VOX musical theatre,
      and previously worked as a Residential Advisor from 2020-2022. I am currently invovled in VOX's production of Urinetown, which will be free for WPI community members
      to attend on September 30th.
